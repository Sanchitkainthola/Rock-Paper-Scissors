# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This Rock Paper Scissors program simulates the universally popular game with functions and conditional statements. So, what better way to get these critical concepts under your belt? As one of many Python coding projects that imports additional libraries, this program uses the standard library’s random, os, and re modules. Take a look at the code below, and you’ll see that this Python project idea asks the user to make the first move by passing in a character to represent rock, paper, or scissors. After evaluating the input string, the conditional logic checks for a winner.
